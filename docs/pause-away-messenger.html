      <span>Privacy Policy</span>
      Your privacy is critically important to us. At Pause Labs, we have a few fundamental principles:

      We do not ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can't stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)
      We do not share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
      We do not store personal information on our servers unless required for the ongoing operation of one of our services.
      In our products, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control public, kept private, and permanently deleted.
      Below is our privacy policy, which incorporates these goals. (Note: This Privacy Policy is based off of Pause' open source privacy policy which can be found at the following link (https://automattic.com/privacy/).)

      If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact our support email.

      Pause Labs, LLC ("Pause") operates several websites, and apps including pauselabs.com, and Pause Away Messenger, respectively. It is Pause's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites, and apps.

      <span>App, and Website Visitors</span>
      Like most website operators, Pause collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Pause's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Pause's visitors use its website. From time to time, Pause may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

      Pause also collects potentially personally-identifying information like your phone contacts for responding to the appropriate incoming message. We never share, or publicly disclose your personal contact information. Pause reads your SMS text messages for triggering the response message once your SMS is receieved on your mobile device. Pause knows the status of your phone calls, to respond to callers when you have auto response activated. Pause has access to your photos so you may respond to incoming calls, and texts with a photo MMS message (Charges may apply). Pause has access to your phones storage for saving past Pause messages. Pause has network access in order to dispatch response messages via your phones 3G/4G connection (Charges may apply).

      <span>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</span>
      Certain visitors to Pause websites choose to interact with Pause in ways that require Pause to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Pause gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. In each case, Pause collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Pause. Pause does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain app-related activities.

      <span>Aggregated Statistics</span>
      Pause may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Pause may monitor app usage, in order to identify how users like to use the app. Pause may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Pause does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

      <span>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</span>
      Pause discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Pause's behalf or to provide services available at Pause's websites, or apps, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Pause's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Pause will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Pause discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Pause believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Pause, third parties or the public at large. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Pause takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

      <span>Business Transfers</span>
      If Pause, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Pause goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Pause may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

      <span>Ads</span>
      Ads appearing on any of our websites, or apps may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Pause and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

      <span>Privacy Policy Changes</span>
      Although most changes are likely to be minor, Pause may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Pause's sole discretion. Pause encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
